print("Hello World")

# This code is contributed by akashish__
##Time Complexity: In the above code “Hello World” is printed only once on the screen. 
#So, the time complexity is constant: O(1) i.e. every time a constant amount of time is required to execute code, no matter which operating system or which machine configurations you are using. 
#Auxiliary Space: O(1)
